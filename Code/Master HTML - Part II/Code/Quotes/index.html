    <p>The goals of Artemis I</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis-i/">
        The primary goals for Artemis I are to demonstrate Orion’s systems 
        in a spaceflight environment and ensure a safe re-entry, descent, splashdown, 
        and recovery prior to the first flight with crew on Artemis II.
